# VanirNet

VanirNet remembers and recollects the god of prophesies and pristine wisdom - Vanir from Norse Mythology

VanirNet is written in the Transaction Execution Approval Language (TEAL), a smart contract language for Algorand PPoS
Algorand is one of the first public permissioned Blockchain Protocol with Pure Proof of Stake Consensus
TEAL is a stack based language with a lot of beautiful constructs to make it secure and stable on a stack based virtual machine.

We are building a Decentralised Oracle Organisation on Algorand using Algorand Smart Contracts written in TEAL
These Smart Contracts demonstrate how we can mobilise physical assets off-chain and moven them on-chain
These assets will be locked on-chain for trade and transactions through Algos through Decentralised Finance protocols.
